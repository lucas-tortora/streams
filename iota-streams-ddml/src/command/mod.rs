//! DDML commands are declared as traits, a new command/trait can be added without breaking old types.
//!
//! Commands usually take arguments, different commands process arguments of different types.
//! Argument types are arguments to traits corresponding to commands.
//!
//! A number of traits can be implemented for a certain type -- Context.
//! Context stores all related information needed to perform the command:
//! IO buffer, Spongos state, private keys, trusted public keys, etc..
//!
//! Trait methods take `&mut self` as input and return `Result<&mut Self>` as output
//! which allows to use the same context in a chain of multiple commands.
//!
//! A command semantic changes depending on which operation is being performed -- Wrap or Unwrap.
//! Beside semantic the type of arguments can also change: input arguments to a wrap
//! command are usually passed by a reference `&T` and output arguments to an unwrap
//! command are passed by a mutable reference `&mut T`.
//!
//! Although Wrap and Unwrap are the two operations related to processing messages,
//! the traits can be implemented for other Contexts and needs. For example, the size of
//! the buffer needed to wrap a message is implemented this way (see `sizeof` module).
//!
//! Command traits are implemented in modules `sizeof`, `wrap`, `unwrap`.
